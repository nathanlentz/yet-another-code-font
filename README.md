  Yet Another Code Font
</h1>

<p align="center">
  While most people seem to install FiraCode and stick with it for years, I think there is much more to offer in the realm of fonts for developers. I hope with this collection, you can discover a new font to improve your developer experience (my favorite is Victor Mono!!). Enjoy! üç£
